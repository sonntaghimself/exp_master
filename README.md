# UNDER MAINTENANCE

This Version of our experiment is no longer running.
Changes that were decided on today (16.11.) are being implemented at the moment.

__*These Include*__:
- Changed proportions. -> In the relevant task, difficulty is manipulated through two different degrees of coherence (independently for each task); In the irrelevant task, a constant degree of coherence is being implemented.
- The response mapping is changed from S & L, to B and Z.
- The Times and presentation kind of the fixation cross have been changed; Now, the task will be displayed above and below the fixation cross in a combined display.
- There will only be feedback on Error commissions. No longer on correct trials.
