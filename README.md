This is the first version(s) of our experiment.

I have adapted the main version, so the direction is no longer lateral. Movements are now up/down.
There is also now a smaller (circular field) the dots are contained in.
Also, the proportions of colours/movement are now represented within all conditions. 
i.e.: distractor color is represented in both movement directions in the overall determined proportion.

The branch shapes will be used to implement a shape version of the task, that incorporates shapes (circle vs. square)
as a second target dimension instead of the movement direction.
