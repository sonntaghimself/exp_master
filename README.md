# exp_master

This is the preliminary version of our first Experiment for the Master's Thesis.

This is the behavioral pilot version.

There is no conflict within the tasks. Conflict arises through the response
congruency between color and movement task.

TODO:
# Instructions need to be rewritten, and increased in size. -> Maybe have them be on 2-3 pages
# Checking the required number of Dots (nDots), in one experiment, they used only 120
# reconsidering the speed of movement.
# Configuring a consistent measurement of frame rate.
