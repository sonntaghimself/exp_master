In this version of the experiment, we will be implementing only one condition
of the distractor task.

i.e.: If color is the relevant dimension, the dots will only be moving either
congruently or incongruently. No competing alternatives within the movement
task.

# NOTE: To me at least, it seems to be a LOT more difficult to discern the
# movement direction if there is only one color present. -> This may elicit the
# need to exacerbate the majority further.

# --> TODO: In this Version of the experiment, the proportions of the Dots are
# not independently controllable for each task. -> Setting the proportion sets
# it for color, as well as movement direction. This has to be adapted!!
